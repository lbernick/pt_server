# Workflow
- When making changes that affect the project structure or build/test scripts, make sure to update the README.md file.
- After making code changes, run tests and lint/formatting and make sure they pass.
- Where possible, practice test driven development; i.e. write tests for features first, then make sure the tests pass once the feature is implemented.
